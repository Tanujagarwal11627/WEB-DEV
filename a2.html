It is no more just a Hindu pilgrimage where devotees gather to cleanse their sins in the holy waters, but is gradually gaining popularity as a hotbed of adventure sports, like river rafting. Brahmapuri is one of the best places for water rafting here. It is perfect for both novice and experienced; initiation, double trouble, Hilton and terminator are some of the rapids that water rafters love to hit here.</p></td>

Several pilgrims undertake the arduous journey to the source of Ganga to absorb the spiritual energy of the sages who once lived here. More recently, trekking in Uttarakhand has begun gaining popularity as a recreational adventure sport.</p></td>
