  <td><p class="ll">Char Dham means Four abodes of God. The four Sanatan / Hindu shrines located in the Himalayan ranges in Uttarakhand attract devotees from India and around the world. All these devotees visit these shrines to attain salvation, the ultimate state of liberation in Hinduism. The Char Dham located in Uttarakhand is called the Chota Char Dham. It is a Hindu pilgrimage circuit, with four sacred abodes, which are Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. Of these, Badrinath is one of the four main Dham/temples established by Shri Adi Shankaracharya. The main char Dham/temples are Badrinath in Uttarakhand, Dwarka in Gujarat, Puri in Odisha, and Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu.

Visiting four Dham / temples in Uttarakhand is a unique experience. Each Dham of this Hindu pilgrimage site is dedicated to a different deity, and each has its significance. Yamunotri, from where the Char Dham Darshan Yatra begins, is dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. Gangotri Dham is dedicated to Goddess Ganga. Kedarnath, which is revered as one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and Badrinath Dham is dedicated to Lord Badri or Vishnu.

  <td><p class="ll">Devotees who make the pilgrimage to these four holy sites of Uttarakhand are clearly inspired by devotion and spirituality. The snowy peaks of the Himalayas, waterfalls, rivers, valleys, lush green forests and grasslands make this religious journey even more exciting. Traditionally, the pilgrimage begins from the West and ends in the East. That's why Char Dham Yatra always starts from Yamunotri, which ends at Badrinath via Gangotri and Kedarnath.

  Before starting this journey, a person has to be prepared to experience physical as well as mental difficulties on the Himalayan roads. The route of Chardham Yatra is quite smooth but still, it is the most difficult religious journey. Travel routes in the state are generally busy during summers. During the journey, the natural beauty of the mountains completely empowers the pilgrims, so that they continue to go joyously towards their destination.</p></td>

  <p class="ll">With a stunning backdrop of the mighty Himalayan ranges, the Valley of Flowers National Park presents an ethereal view and an unforgettable experience for visitors. Spread over an area of 87 sq km in the Chamoli district, the Valley of Flowers National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and forms one of the two core zones (the other being the Nanda Devi National Park) of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve.

The valley is believed to have been discovered in 1931, when three British mountaineers – led by Frank S Smythe – lost their way and chanced upon this spectacular valley. Attracted by the beauty of this place they named it the “Valley of Flowers”.</p></td>

    <p class="ll">Hardly 3 km from Badrinath, Mana is the last village at the Uttarakhand Indo-Tibetan border. This quaint village is around 3219 m above sea level and boasts a clearer sky and cleaner air. Resting on the banks of River Saraswati, Mana is home to the Bhotias (Mongol tribe). One can spend an entire day here appreciating the exquisitely carved rustic cottages. Detox yourself in the calmness of Mana while enjoying the cascade at the Vasundhara Falls. Gaze and goggle at the origin of the Saraswati River. Watch her gracefully flow into the Alaknanda River to form the Keshav Prayag. Catch sight of the sturdy Bheem Pul. Gain some enriching experience at the annual fair of Mata Murti temple and sip on the warmth of tea at the last Indian tea stall. Mana is much more than a mythological experience. It is a boon for trek lovers. </p></td>

This revered place is the major landmark of the holy city of Haridwar. Literally, "Har" means "God", "Ki" means " 's " and "Pauri" means "steps". Lord Vishnu is believed to have visited the Brahmakund in Har Ki Pauri in the Vedic times.[1]

It is believed that it is the precise spot where the Ganges leaves the mountains and enters the plains. The ghat is on the west bank of Ganges canal through which the Ganges is diverted just to the north. Har Ki Pauri is also the area where thousands of pilgrims converge and the festivities commence during the Kumbha Mela, which takes place every twelve years, and the Ardh Kumbh Mela, which takes place every six years and the Punjabi festival of Vaisakhi, a harvest festival occurring every year in the month of April.</p>
